### **Step-by-Step Product Development Plan: Building the Study-in-Germany Platform**

Hereâ€™s a structured, incremental plan to build the platform. Each phase will have clearly defined features, their purpose, and specific tasks for developers. This approach ensures steady progress and manageable complexity.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)**

#### **Features to Build:**
1. **User Authentication System**
   - Sign-up/login via email and password.
   - Role-based access (e.g., basic users, premium users).

2. **University Finder (Basic)**
   - Search and filter universities based on:
     - Field of study.
     - Language of instruction.
     - Tuition fees.
   - Provide static data for now (populate the database manually or scrape from DAAD.de).

3. **Basic Visa Assistance**
   - Static visa checklist (PDF or web page).
   - Notify users via email for common reminders (e.g., document deadlines).

---

#### **Developer Tasks:**
1. **Set Up Project and Tech Stack**
   - Backend: Set up Flask/Django with PostgreSQL.
   - Frontend: Basic UI using React.js/HTML templates.
   - DevOps: Set up version control (GitHub/GitLab) and deploy to a staging environment (Heroku or AWS).
   
2. **Build User Authentication**
